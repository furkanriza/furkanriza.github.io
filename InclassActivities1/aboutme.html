    <div style="font-size: 1.675rem;">
      I'm a senior Computer Engineering student at Ankara Yıldırım Beyazıt University with a current GPA of 3.20. My
      academic journey has deeply rooted me in the fundamentals of computer science, with a particular emphasis on
      backend development specifically with Java. My experiences honed my skills in using Spring Boot, Hibernate,
      Docker, RESTful APIs, postgresql, Microsoft SQL server and cloud computing platforms like AWS. I am also
      well-versed in React.js and Angular framework which complements my backend skills by enabling me to understand and
      contribute to the full spectrum of a web application's development.
